Yatra is a film that celebrates the life and achievements of one of the most influential leaders of Andhra Pradesh. It is a must-watch for anyone who wants to learn more about the history and politics of the state.

One of the most memorable scenes in Yatra is when YSR meets a farmer named Ravi who has lost his crops due to drought and is unable to repay his loans. Ravi tells YSR that he has no hope left and is planning to commit suicide. YSR consoles him and assures him that he will waive off all the farm loans if he comes to power. He also gives him his personal phone number and asks him to call him anytime. Ravi is moved by YSR's gesture and decides to live on.
 
This scene is based on a real incident that happened during YSR's padayatra[^1^]. YSR met a farmer named Ravi Shankar in Nizamabad district who was in a similar situation. YSR gave him his phone number and asked him to call him after the elections. Ravi Shankar did call YSR after he became the chief minister and reminded him of his promise. YSR kept his word and announced a loan waiver scheme for the farmers in his first budget.
 
Another touching scene in Yatra is when YSR meets a young girl named Lalitha who is suffering from a heart ailment and needs surgery. Lalitha tells YSR that her parents are poor and cannot afford the medical expenses. She also tells him that she wants to become a doctor and serve the poor. YSR is moved by her innocence and courage and promises to help her. He also tells her that he will launch a health insurance scheme for the poor that will cover all the major diseases.
 
This scene is also inspired by a real incident that happened during YSR's padayatra[^1^]. YSR met a girl named Lalitha Kumari in Khammam district who had a hole in her heart and needed surgery. YSR arranged for her treatment and later launched the Arogyasri scheme that provided free health care to the poor. Lalitha Kumari underwent surgery and recovered well. She also fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor and joined the Arogyasri scheme as a medical officer.
